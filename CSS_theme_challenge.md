# The CSS Theme Challenge

## Setup

> Create a new repo on github called css-theme-challenge

> Create a setup branch and do the usual.

## Requirements

Visit [TEMPLATED](https://templated.co/) and explore some of the designs. Pick a design you like and recreate it.

Think carefully about how you create your HTML to ensure that it appropriately uses semantic and non semantic tags.

Your CSS should be clean and well organized.

Your goal is to recreate these themes on your own. don't download and copy them, that's just a waste of all of our time!

* **main.css** - for styling.  At minimum you should use the bootstrap grid system but feel free to style however you would like.
* **main.js** - the entry point to your app
* **store.js** - should hold your book object as a private variable.  Should have an event listener for the add to cart button

* **util.js** - should have the printToDom function.

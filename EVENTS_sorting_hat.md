# Sorting Hat

## Instructions
You are in charge of bringing the Hogwarts sorting hat to life! 

To start off with, you will use a [bootstrap jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) to have your sorting hat introduce itself and start the sorting process (by clicking on a button). A form will then appear to fill in the student's name and a button to sort. This should then assign the student to a random house (Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin).
